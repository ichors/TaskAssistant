TaskAssistant
=============

Small Android utility to help using my task manager app by
- generating current or custom set date and time
- generating task header with current or custom set date and time
and copy it to clipboard so that it can be inserted.

Existing clipboard content may be inserted after the generated date and time (disabled by default).

May be useful for any Android app where text notes are to be edited.
